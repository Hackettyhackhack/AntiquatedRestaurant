AntiquatedRestaurant


For the ECF exam, we were asked to create a cooks website. 

On the home page you'll find an introductory landing page as well as menues. 

On the gallery page you'll find images of the different main courses the chef proposes as well as a Booking button
so that the user will be orientated to reserve a table. 

On the Reservations page, you'll find a comment box, as I have not yet mastered reservations. 

In the Opening times, you'll find an acordion style times table to discover what time the restaurant is open. 

On the about page, a quick description and photo of the head chef and owner of website, as well as a comment box for users to send messages
directly to him.
